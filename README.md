# **Selenium**

Selenium is a free tool used to **automate web browsers**. It helps testers and developers by performing actions like **clicking buttons, typing in forms, selecting options, and navigating pages**—just like a real user would—but without doing it manually.

## **Why We Use Selenium**

- **Save time** by automating repetitive tasks.  
- **Check websites on different browsers** to make sure they work everywhere.  
- **Catch errors quickly** and make testing more accurate.
